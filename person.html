            <p class="paragraph-light free">Hello there! I&#x27;m Tomiwa Ajiboye, a Product Designer based in Saskatchewan, Canada. I also go by the nicknames Topboy (given to me by my high school pals) and Tommy (newer friends call me this). <br />‍ <br />I transitioned to Software Design after completing my Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering because of a newfound passion for Tech. I’m now building a career at the intersection of Design, Tech and Marketing. <br />‍ <br />My journey as a software designer kicked off in 2020 when <a href="https://www.opemipo.com/" target="_blank" class="link-2">Ope</a> started <a href="https://www.wuruwuru.com/" target="_blank" class="link-2">wuruwuru</a>. He created wuruwuru as a playground to explore ideas centred around design, art and media in the Nigerian ecosystem, and it has grown to become a community studio where we make passion projects with independent creators. <br />‍ <br />Working with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds has shaped me into a designer that prioritizes understanding clients’ needs in order to deliver effective solutions. The projects I&#x27;ve worked on have also taught me how to acquire new skills and learn new tools required to take on any tasks assigned to me. </p>

            <h1 class="interest-heading mobile-fix">Writing</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light landscape">Some will say writing is you documenting for your future self. Asides from writing about my work process, I also write to process my thoughts and ground myself. In 2021, I started keeping a daily journal to keep track of my growth as an adult, and I ended up doing this for 420 days consecutively. This helped me reflect on how much work I’d put into developing myself, and significantly improved my ability to articulate myself.</p>

            <h1 class="interest-heading mobile-fix">Music</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light landscape">Music is food for my soul. It’s a universal language that connects us in ways words cannot fully explain. When a song resonates with my soul, there’s a surreal feeling that comes along with it, and I can almost tell within the first 20-30 seconds of hearing a new song if I’m going to like it. <br />For me, the type of music that resonates is rarely about the lyrics. It’s the beat, the rhythm and the flow of how everything syncs together to create a beautiful piece of art that’s pleasing to the auditory senses. </p>

            <h1 class="interest-heading mobile-fix">Art &amp; Design</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light landscape">A go-to first date idea for me will always be to attend an art exhibition. When I was younger, I wanted to be an artist of some sort. However, artists didn&#x27;t make a lot of money back in those days, so my parents convinced me to pursue a career in engineering based on their own life experiences. While studying engineering, I always felt like a creative trying to break into a strictly theoretical world, but it wasn’t terrible as I was able to adapt. I was lucky enough to realize I didn’t want to feel like an imposter for most of my life so I used my final year to explore different career paths that stood out to me. I chose User Experience Design because it involves combining the ability to create visually compelling assets and seamless experiences that solve people’s problems with minimal theoretical rules to follow.</p>

            <h1 class="interest-heading mobile-fix">Sports</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light landscape">I really love sports in all its forms. Sports never fail to captivate my interest, whether it&#x27;s the complexities of gameplay or the sheer physicality. Throughout the years, I&#x27;ve actively participated in a variety of sports, including Football, Basketball, Tennis, Cycling and long-distance running. If the environment I grew up in supported it, I probably would be pursuing a career as a professional athlete.</p>

            <h1 class="interest-heading mobile-fix">Travel</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light landscape">While I&#x27;ve not done a lot of travelling, I am deeply fascinated by the idea of living in different parts of the world. I’d love to learn about different cultures and languages that resonates strongly with me, and I&#x27;m curious to expand my mind to understanding the experiences that have shaped people to be who they are.</p>

            <h1 class="interest-heading mobile-fix">Psychology</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light landscape">Once I&#x27;ve attained a certain level of financial stability and gained ample teamwork experience, my goal is to return to school to study Psychology. I see myself as someone who understands emotions well and is curious about why people behave the way they do and what makes each person unique. I believe that studying psychology will enhance my understanding of the world and provide me with a clearer perspective.</p>
