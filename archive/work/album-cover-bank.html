It currently has over 5,000 covers, and it provides a unique and comprehensive view of the evolution of Nigerian album art. The project first began as an exploration of the relationship between graphic trends in Nigerian pop culture and their influence on Nigerian music throughout the years. <br />
              <br />However, during our desk research, we realized that the initial idea was too broad, so we narrowed our focus to curating a database of Nigerian album cover art in other to preserve their work.

              <br />We chose Airtable for the database because of its versatile data storage and display capabilities. However, the Airtable website design had room for improvement and presented some usability challenges. <br />

We sent out a tweet and 4 people (One designer and three writers) responded to the form in the tweet with a pitch. <br />‍ <br />We set up a group call with the contestants to kick off the project, and the outcome of the call was that I’ll pair up with Idris, the designer, to build the project and create an operation plan to help guide everyone on what the final outcome of the project should look like. <br />

              <br />Lina volunteered to take it on, she partnered with Toyosi to build the website from scratch using React, SCSS, GitHub and Airtable’s API Document. <br />

There were some challenges with how Airtable handled API calls; it processed only 100 data sets at a time, clearing each set before moving on to the next 100. This was problematic for the project because it involved displaying a large amount of data (over 5,000 covers). <br />
            <br />Lina and I found this to be quite frustrating because we had come too far to change our database tool, so we consulted Tomi, who has experience with using Airtable as a third-party database for building websites. He acknowledged that the amount of data we were trying to display was too much for Airtable to handle, so he suggested two different methods to address this: <br />‍ <br />- Pre-load all the data onto the site when it loads to avoid frequent API calls. However, this approach could slow down the site. Alternatively; <br />-Transfer the data to a simpler database like Google Sheets. The downside here is that we’d lose some of Airtable’s visual power on the database end. <br />
            <br />Lina eventually figured out how to pre-load the data on the site without slowing down its speed, but it came at the cost of making numerous design changes to the site like; displaying the covers in an overlay screen, switching from pagination to an infinite scroll, taking out the total number of covers on the database…
